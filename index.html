            <h3 class="title">Miami Dolphins score 70 points and take a knee rather than take a shot at NFL scoring mark in record.</h3>
            <p class="text">MIAMI -- Dolphins running back De'Von Achane had a few text messages to answer after Sunday's 70-20 win over the Denver Broncos. Actually, it was closer to 100, the rookie clarified which durig the first prominent role of his career, the third-round pick compiled 233 total yards and four touchdowns, including 203 rushing yards on 18 carries. He was asked after the game whether he had more total yards or notifications on his phone.



In one of the most lopsided games in NFL history, the Dolphins put up 726 yards as the league's best offense went berserk in its home opener. The point total marked a new franchise record and the most points any NFL team has scored since Washington scored 72 against the New York Giants in 1966.



In total, the Dolphins recorded nearly as many rushing yards (350) as passing yards (376), averaging 10.2 yards per play in the process.



"respect" and the Dolphins weren't trying to "go out and humiliate teams."

Running back Raheem Mostert finished with 142 total yards and four combined touchdowns, pushing his league-leading season total to six rushing touchdowns through three games, already surpassing his 2022 total (three). Mostert is on pace for 1,360 yards and 34 touchdowns, which would shatter the career highs of 891 and eight he set in 2022 and 2019, respectively.

He and Achane are the first pair of teammates ever to each score four touchdowns from scrimmage in the same game.

Impressively, while Hill recorded nine catches for 157 yards and a touchdown, Miami's offense did all of this without wide receiver Jaylen Waddle, who was unable to clear the concussion protocol.

"We always have the next-guy mentality going, but when we do have Jaylen Waddle, it does present a lot more challenges for defenses," Tagovailoa said. "But needless to say, we've got our run game going. We had our deal with our pass game, our action game. I'm very proud of the guys and the way they came out."

Defensively, the Dolphins allowed 363 yards and 6.2 yards per play but pressured quarterback Russell Wilson 20 times, forcing three turnovers and sacking him once. They also held Denver (0-3) to just three third-down conversions on 12 attempts.

Wilson completed 23 of 38 passes for 306 yards, one touchdown and one interception, marking just his third 300-yard passing game in a Broncos uniform. The nine-time Pro Bowler said this was a game the team wanted to learn from, but not necessarily think about anymore.


"From a leadership standpoint, I think the biggest thing we have to do is learn everything that we can from the film," he said. "Learn what we did well. Learn what we didn't do so well. Learn that every game has a history of its own. ... That was one we want to put in -- not think about anymore, but we have to learn from it still.

"We hadn't experienced that one before. But like I said, every game has a history of its own. And what we have to do is we have to be focused on what's ahead of us, and that's trying to get ready to go play the Chicago Bears on the road."

Miami, which has started 3-0 in back-to-back seasons under McDaniel, takes its undefeated record into Buffalo in Week 4 for an AFC East showdown with the Bills.


“We’re not trying to humiliate teams,” Tagovailoa said.

Note: the previous regular-season scoring record, held by the Washington franchise in a 72-41 win over the New York Giants on Nov. 27, 1966, still stands.

“I will be fine getting second guessed by turning down NFL records. That’s fine,” McDaniel said. “I am very, very okay with the decision … That’s called karma, and I’m trying to keep good karma with the Miami Dolphins.”
